#### Welcome to the page of Benchmarking Structural Inference Methods for Dynamical Interacting Systems.

## About

The StructInf dataset is a collection of synthetic dynamical systems.

- The dataset contains more than 2,772 trajectories of interacting dynamical systems.
- The feature dimensions vary from one to four.
- The trajectories with Gaussian noise enable the objective evaluation of the robustness of structural inference methods.
